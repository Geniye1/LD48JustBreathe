# LD48JustBreathe
Just Breathe, the game I made for Ludum Dare 48

You are Boomy Lee and have been cursed with both invincibility and the ability to explode if you don't control your breathing, maybe half a curse half a blessing?

The theme for LD48 was "Deeper and Deeper" so this game is about rhythmically keeping your breath to prevent yourself from exploding. The aim is to go around 
the room and finish all the tasks without losing (which is if you damage too many objects in the room). The challenge is you have to keep both the rhythm of 
your breathe and the key presses. Didn't externally play test it so not 100% sure but I feel like it does add a bit of challenge.

If you look at the code and wonder "Why the hell did he program this like this?" It is because I was rushing and when there is rush there is no logic so stuff's
just kinda haphazardly thrown together towards the end.
